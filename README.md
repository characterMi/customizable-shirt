# 3D product website

Many large corporations already use 3D graphics to showcase their products. this is what I've created with threeJs

- You can change the color of the shirt with a color picker, you can even upload a image and use it for texture or full texture

- this is my first project with threeJs and react-three-fiber, i hope you like it !
